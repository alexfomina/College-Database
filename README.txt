Implementation of a simple database system using a special type of binary search tree. The user is able to insert, delete, and query data.  

The DB itself will contain data that would be commonly found in a university’s computer system.  In our case, this information consists of student and faculty records.  The information for each will be stored in its own tree (or “table” in DB terminology).
